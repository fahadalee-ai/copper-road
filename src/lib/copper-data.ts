    q: "Pickup or delivery?",
    a: "We prioritize safe, low-stress, in-person placement whenever possible. We offer local pickup, delivery within a reasonable distance, and meet-up options when available. At this time, we do not ship our kittens.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are kittens vaccinated and health checked?",
    a: "Yes. We prioritize health, temperament, and proper development above all. Spay or neuter for pet kittens must be completed between 6–8 months of age unless otherwise approved in writing. Declawing is not permitted.",
  },
  {
    q: "What temperament can I expect?",
    a: "We focus heavily on temperament. Kittens are raised underfoot, not in cages. They are handled daily and exposed to normal household life, making them well-socialized, confident companions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are your cats registered?",
    a: "Yes. All of our breeding cats and kittens are registered through recognized cat registries (such as TICA and/or CFA) and come from lines with documented 5-generation pedigrees. Pet kittens are typically sold with limited registration. Full registration is only available to approved programs.",
